# Mod21Challenge

##  Getting Started

Create a fungible token that is ERC-20 compliant and that will be minted by using a Crowdsale contract from the OpenZeppelin Solidity library. 

Build an Ethereum token contract.

Implement Ethereum community token standards.

Develop a crowsdale contract that can provide an initial coin offering (ICO) for a token.

The crowdsale contract will manage the entire crowdsale process, allowing users to send ether to the contract and in return receive KAI, or KaseiCoin 

tokens. 

This will mint the tokens automatically and distribute them to buyers in one transaction.

# Prerequisites
Solidity using Remix IDE

Solidity is a programming language for implementing smart contracts in the Ethereum blockchain

Use Solidity to create a smart contract. This smart contract will automate the creation of joint saving accounts. 

Set up a local blockchain development environment.

Build smart contract by using Solidity.

Implement functions in your smart contract to transfer and withdraw funds.

Deploy a smart contract in an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
